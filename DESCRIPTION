Description: Implements a multi-path forward selection procedure based on the 
    Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Instead of following a single best path,
    this package explores multiple promising model paths simultaneously, evaluates
    their stability through resampling, and identifies plausible models that are
    both statistically sound (low AIC) and reliable (built from stable predictors).
    Supports both linear and logistic regression.
