\usage{
plausible_models(
  path_result,
  stability_result = NULL,
  Delta = 2,
  tau = 0.6,
  remove_duplicates = TRUE,
  jaccard_threshold = 0.9,
  refit = FALSE,
  X = NULL,
  y = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_result}{Output from build_paths()}

\item{stability_result}{Output from stability() (or NULL to skip stability filtering)}

\item{Delta}{Numeric: AIC tolerance. Keep models with AIC ≤ AIC_min + Delta. Default: 2}

\item{tau}{Numeric: minimum average stability threshold (0 to 1). Default: 0.6}

\item{remove_duplicates}{Logical: remove near-duplicate models? Default: TRUE}

\item{jaccard_threshold}{Numeric: Jaccard similarity threshold for duplicate detection.
Models with similarity > threshold are considered duplicates. Default: 0.9}

\item{refit}{Logical: refit final models on full data? Default: FALSE}

\item{X}{Matrix of predictors (needed if refit = TRUE)}

\item{y}{Response vector (needed if refit = TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row is a plausible model with columns:
\item{model_id}{String identifier for the model}
\item{size}{Number of predictors in the model}
\item{variables}{Character string of variables (comma-separated)}
\item{aic}{AIC value}
\item{delta_aic}{Difference from minimum AIC}
\item{avg_stability}{Average stability score (if stability_result provided)}
\item{fitted_model}{Fitted model object (if refit = TRUE)}
}
\description{
This function filters the models from multi-path search to identify "plausible"
models: those that are both statistically sound (AIC close to the best) and
reliable (built from stable predictors).
}
\details{
The algorithm works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Find the minimum AIC across all models in the path forest
\item Keep models with AIC ≤ AIC_min + Delta (within Delta of the best)
\item For each kept model S, compute average stability: π(S) = mean(π_j for j in S)
\item Keep only models with π(S) ≥ tau (average stability threshold)
\item Optionally remove near-duplicates using Jaccard similarity
}
