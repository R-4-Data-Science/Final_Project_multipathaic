\title{Multi-Path Forward Selection Using AIC}
\usage{
build_paths(
  X,
  y,
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial"),
  K = NULL,
  eps = 1e-06,
  delta = 1,
  L = 50,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix or data frame of predictors (n x p)}

\item{y}{Response vector (length n)}

\item{family}{Character string: "gaussian" for linear regression or "binomial" for logistic}

\item{K}{Integer: maximum number of steps (model size). Default: min(ncol(X), 10)}

\item{eps}{Numeric: minimum AIC improvement required to continue expanding. Default: 1e-6}

\item{delta}{Numeric: AIC tolerance for keeping near-ties. If delta=0, only keep single best.
Default: 1}

\item{L}{Integer: maximum number of models to keep per step. Default: 50}

\item{verbose}{Logical: print progress messages? Default: FALSE}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\item{frontiers}{A list of length K, where each element contains the models at that step}
\item{aic_by_model}{A named list of AIC values for all models}
\item{meta}{Metadata including parameters used}
}
\description{
This function implements a multi-path forward selection algorithm that explores
multiple promising model paths simultaneously, rather than following just a single
"best" sequence. At each step, it adds predictors that improve AIC and keeps all
models that perform nearly as well as the best one.
}
\details{
The algorithm works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Start with the empty model (intercept only)
\item At each step k = 1 to K:
\itemize{
\item From every current model (parent), try adding each unused variable (children)
\item Compute AIC for each candidate child
\item For each parent, keep all children within delta of that parent's best AIC
\item Only keep children if they improve parent AIC by at least eps
\item Deduplicate and keep best L models if there are too many
}
\item Return the collection of models at each step (a tree of paths)
}
}

# Linear regression example

p <- 5
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
colnames(X) <- paste0("x", 1:p)
y <- X[,1] + 0.5 * X[,2] + rnorm(n)

# Run multi-path search
result <- build_paths(X, y, family = "gaussian", K = 3, delta = 1)
